# gm_express_service.cr

This is the alternative backend web project that supports the [GMod Express Addon](https://github.com/cfc-Servers/gm_express).

## Installation

### Ubuntu
You need local redis server running
```bash
curl -fsSL https://crystal-lang.org/install.sh | sudo bash
git clone https://github.com/Rorkh/gm_express_service.cr express_service
shards run
```
### Docker
Will be soon

## Project goals
No goals. Just learning Crystal. I'm not sure it's more performant (but maybe).
